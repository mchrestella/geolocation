Supply Chain Optimization and Geolocation Analysis (GIS, Python, Tableau, PowerBI, Excel)

As the data sets used in my analysis were obtained from proprietary GIS and Bridgeport dashboards, along with the code used to develop the interactive dashboards and frameworks, I am unable to publicly share this work due to confidentiality agreements. However, I would be happy to discuss my approach, methodologies, and key learnings in detail during an interview or phone call!
